Chapter 1: A Quick Tour

Simple Java Program: One class.


class FibonacciTrill{
	public static void main (String[] args){

		/* Find the sum of terms in fibonacci sequence that
    are multiples of 10, less than 1 trillion*/
		long sum=0;
		long a=1,b=1;	
		while (a<1000000000000){
						
			b=a+b;
			a=b-a;
			if(a%10==0){
				sum+=a;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}




How to run the program?
First save as FibonacciTrill.java
Then run command javac FibonacciTrill.java
Then run java FibonacciTrill


NB: First, you have to install JDK. This will give you java and javac (java compiler).
Second, the command "java FibonacciTrill" refers to the class name.
So far, I have been compiling programs with ONE class and the name of the file is the name
of the class.


QUESTION? What happens when you compile a .java file with multiple classes in it?
Does your folder fill up with a bunch of .class files?


----------------------------

primitive datatypes in Java:

boolean: True or False
char: 16-bit unicode character (unsigned)
byte: 8 bit integer (signed)
short: 16 bit integer (signed)
int: 32 bit integer (signed)
long: 64 bit integer (signed)
float: 32 bit floating point IEEE 754
double: 64 bit floating point IEEE 754

in most contexts the language automatically converts between primitive types and wrapper class

---------------------------------

Control flow:
for, ifelse, switch, dowhile, while...

syntax example: 
if (a<b)
	return a;
else
	return b;
	
No colons, as there are in python.


-------------------------------------


named constants are a good idea.

static final int MAX=50; //maximum value for something

groups of named constants are nicely represented by enums (enumeration)
enum is a special class with named constants

enum Suit {CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES};

-----------------------------------------------

Classes and objects

Every object has a class that defines its DATA and BEHAVIOR
Every class has three kinds of members:
	1. Fields are data variables associated with a class and its objects
	2. Methods are the executable code of a class
	3. Classes and interfaces can be members of other classes and interfaces
	
simple examples

class Point{
	//point in a two-dimensional plane
	public double x,y;
}

class Circle{
	//circle in a two-dimesional plane
	public double x,y,radius;
}


Objects are created with expressions involving the keyword new
	
This is important: objects are accessed via object references.
Variables that hold an object actually hold a reference to an object.
The type of such a variable is a reference type.
Primitive types hold the values of that type.



instance variables:
consider if you make two points.
Each instance has different x and y.

class Point{
	public double x,y;
}
Point left = new Point();
Point right = new Point();
left.x=0;
left.y=0;
right.x=10;
right.y=0;

left.x=5;

Static or Class fields
All objects of that class share a variable.

Let us make the Point class more complex.

class Point{
	
	private double x,y;
	
	public void clear(){
	x=0.0;
	y=0.0;
	}
	
	public double getx(){
		return x;
	}
	
	public double gety(){
		return y;
	}
	
	public double distance (Point other){
		double xdist=x-other.getx();
		double ydist=y-other.gety();
		return Math.sqrt(xdist*xdist+ydist*ydist);
	}

}
	
	
Array: a collection of variables all of the same type.
Array's length is fixed when created and can never change!
When an array is created, its elements are implicitly initialized to null.

Array has length field.

a = new Point[10];
a.length==10;


conditional OR: || instead of |. evaluates right hand side only if lefthand side is true

if(values==null || values.length==0)
	throw new IllegalArgumentException():
	
if values==null, then values.length==0 will be an exception!
so you want to check left hand side first and only then proceed


String str="abcde";
str.charAt(0)=='a';
String objects are read-only and immutable
Every time you goof with a string, you get  anew one.
StringBuilder and StringBuffer provide for mutable strings.
If you are building a string, use one of those. Otherwise you are creating
all your intermediate steps as strings, unnecessarily adding to the number 
of objects.

String a="fuck";
String b="fuc";

b=b+"k";
a==b;//false
a.equals(b);//true

String c=a;
a==c;//true
a="shit";
c.equals("fuck");//true


Extending a class
You can extend or subclass a class. If the subclass does not specifically override the behavior
of the superclass, then it inherits all of the behavior (fields, methods).

Invoking method of superclass. "super" is like "this"

Classes that do not extend another class implicitly extend Object.

You can always instantiate an object by naming a superclass.

class GayPoint extends Point{
	boolean orientation;
	public void init(double xx,double yy){
		super.init(xx,yy);
		orientation=!orientation;
	}
}


Point p = new Point();
Point q = new GayPoint();
Object r = new Point();
r = "a string";


Type casting
String name = "Tim";
Object obj = name;
name=obj;// WILL NOT COMPILE

What happened? name is a reference to a String. obj is a reference to an Object.
obj can point to name. but name cannot point to obj.

name = (String) obj; //OK

Interfaces
Sometimes you only want to declare methods that an object must support, but not implement them.
Interface can declare static final members (constants). All members of interface are public.

Generic Types
Classes and interfaces can be declared to be generic types.
Then you use "implements" instead of "extends"

How it is done: with <>
interface Lookup<T>{
	T find (String name);
}

Chapter 2: Classes and Objects

 type				initial value
 boolean			false
 char				'\u0000'
 byte, short, int, long		0
 float, double			+0.0
 object reference		null
 
 static fields are shared by all instances of a class
 final fields are constant, immutable
 
 access control
 private members only accessible in the class
 package members only accessible to classes in package
 protected members accessible in the class and subclasses
 public members accessible anywhere the class is
 
 access control is per-class or per-interface, NOT per object
 
 making constructor
 
 a simple pattern is to have increasing complexity based on arguments
 
 class Body{
 	public int idNum;
	public String name = "<unnamed>";
	public Body orbits = null;
	private static int nextID = 0;
	
	Body(){
		idNum = nextID++;
	}
	
	Body(String bodyName){
		this();
		name=bodyName;
	}
	
	Body(String bodyName, Body orbitsAround){
		this(bodyName);
		orbits=orbitsAround;
	}
	
	//copy constructor
	Body (Body other){
		idNum=other.idNum;
		name=other.name;
		orbits=other.orbits;
	}
 
 }



static methods are class methods. static methods can only access static members.

reference.method(arguments)


every method has a specific number of parameters of specific types
however!, the last parameter can be a sequence
for example (String...)

private void something(boolean wut, String... messages){
	//blah
}
this method can be called with 
something(false, "hi")
something(true, "hi","ho","foo")
etc.




in Java, parameters to methods are passed "by value"!
that means you are working with a copy, you can manipulate the parameter
without having side effects on what you are working with.


each method has a signature (number and type of parameters)
you can overload a method by writing it with different parameters

public boolean orbitsAround(Body other){
	return (orbits==other);
}

public boolean orbitsAround(int id){
	return (orbits!=null && orbits.idNum==id);
}

import static java.lang.Math.exp; //whenever compiler sees exp, it looks here
import static java.lang.Math.*; //whever compiler sees unknown methods, it checks Math



=================================================================
Chapter 3: Extending Classes

the constructor of an extended class can invoke one of the superclass's constructors

class Point{
	double x,y;
	Point(double x,double y){
	this.x=x;
	this.y=y;
	}
}

class Ball extends Point{
	double radius;
	Ball(double x, double y, double radius){
		super(x,y);
		this.radius=radius;
	}
}


constructor order dependencies
1. Invoke superclass constructor
2. Initialize fields using initializers and initializer blocks
3. Execute body of constructor


overriding method
if you override a method, you have a method with the same signature but different return type.
the only way this is allowed is if return type is a subtype of the overridden return type


private methods are not accessible to sublcasses


Java has single inheritance. If you want multiple inheritance, you will need an interface.
