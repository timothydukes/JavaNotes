Simple Java Program: One class.




class FibonacciTrill{
	public static void main (String[] args){

		/* Find the sum of terms in fibonacci sequence that
    are multiples of 10, less than 1 trillion*/
		long sum=0;
		long a=1,b=1;	
		while (a<1000000000000){
						
			b=a+b;
			a=b-a;
			if(a%10==0){
				sum+=a;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}




How to run the program?
First save as FibonacciTrill.java
Then run command javac FibonacciTrill.java
Then run java FibonacciTrill


NB: First, you have to install JDK. This will give you java and javac (java compiler).
Second, the command "java FibonacciTrill" refers to the class name.
So far, I have been compiling programs with ONE class and the name of the file is the name
of the class.


QUESTION? What happens when you compile a .java file with multiple classes in it?
Does your folder fill up with a bunch of .class files?
